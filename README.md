## Howdy? adinsoon here :)

#### I'm Adrian and I'm currently a student at Wroclaw University of Technology. 
##### :nerd_face: My specialization is cybersecurity but I like programming various things as well.
##### ðŸŽ“ I'm open to learning and acquiring new skills! 
##### ðŸŽ¯ I associate my future with the simultaneous growth on two areas: cybersecurity and programming. The combination of these fields will provide me with knowledge about threats and possibilities of protection against them already at the stage of code development, and knowledge of programming issues will improve the process of searching for areas where vulnerabilities and security gaps may occur. I am especially focused on improving my skills related to creating web applications and in this direction I want to take my further professional path, both in terms of development and security.
